Welcome to the TRAIN Bridge Deployment API quickstart guide! This guide will walk you through deploying your own trustless bridge between blockchains. Let's get started!

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts
- Access to your network's RPC endpoints
- Your network's chain ID and contract addresses

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your API Keys">
    <Info>
      The TRAIN Bridge Deployment API is currently in early access. Request your API keys by completing [this form](https://ix9g7fdi92w.typeform.com/to/EFRPexAw).
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prepare Your Network Information">
    Before deploying, you'll need to gather some key information about your network:
    - Chain ID (a unique identifier for your blockchain)
    - Network name and display name
    - Logo URL
    - Network type (e.g., EVM_OPTIMISM_EIP1559 for OP Stack rollups)
    - Bridge and oracle contract addresses
    - RPC endpoints (both public and private)
    - Block explorer URLs

    <Tip>
      Not sure about some values? Check our [Network Configuration Guide](/api-reference) for detailed explanations.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy Your Bridge">
    Use the Deploy Bridge API endpoint to start your deployment. Here's a complete example using curl:

    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://atomic-dev.layerswap.cloud/api/v0.2/deployment \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'X-V8-APIKEY: <api-key>' \
      --data '{
      "chain_id": 45646545646,
      "network_name": "YourNetwork_TESTNET",
      "network_display_name": "Your Network Testnet",
      "logo_url": "<url to logo>",
      "network_group": "EVM_OPTIMISM_EIP1559",
      "is_testnet": true,
      "canonical_bridge_address": "0x1200000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      "gas_price_oracle": "0x420000000000000000000000000000000000000F",
      "native_asset_symbol": "ETH",
      "native_asset_decimals": 18,
      "public_rpc": "https://ethereum.publicnode.com",
      "private_rpc": "https://ethereum.publicnode.com",
      "address_lookup_explorer_template": "https://etherscan.io/address/{0}",
      "tx_lookup_explorer_template": "https://etherscan.io/tx/{0}"
    }'
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace the placeholder values with your actual network information. The API will return a deployment ID that you'll use to check the status.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Deployment Progress">
    After initiating deployment, you can check its status using the Deployment Status endpoint:

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url https://atomic-dev.layerswap.cloud/api/v0.2/deployment/{deploymentId} \
      --header 'X-V8-APIKEY: <api-key>'
    ```

    <Tip>
      Keep polling this endpoint until you see the status change to `Completed`. This usually takes a few minutes.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Using Your Bridge">
    Once deployment is complete, your network is ready for bridging! Visit the [TRAIN App](https://app.train.tech) to:
    - View your network in the list of supported chains
    - Start bridging assets to and from your network
    - Monitor bridge transactions
  </Step>
</Steps>
