## Overview

The Auction Manager is a centralized component that coordinates the selection of Solvers for user swap intents. The process works as follows:

1. **Solver Registration**: Solvers register with the Auction Manager and advertise their availability for specific chains and assets.
2. **Quote Request**: When a user initiates a swap intent via the dApp, the Auction Manager requests quotes from eligible Solvers.
3. **Winner Selection**: The Auction Manager evaluates quotes based on criteria such as price, speed, and reputation, then selects the best Solver as the winner.
4. **User Commit**: The user commits funds on the source chain, naming the winning Solver in the commit transaction.
5. **Solver Lock & Completion**: The winning Solver locks funds on the destination chain and completes the swap. The Auction Manager enforces reliability through reputation tracking and slashing mechanisms.

## Auction Flow (On-Chain)

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Commit">
    The user commits funds on the source chain by calling the `commit()` function, specifying the winning Solver's address and a timelock that defines the swap duration. The `commit()` function emits a `TokenCommitted` event. The timelock should allow sufficient time for the swap to complete; it must later be reduced in `addLock()` to establish proper refund ordering and prevent Solver misbehavior.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Solver Lock">
    The winning Solver observes the `TokenCommitted` event and locks equivalent funds on the destination chain by calling the `lock()` function with the same intent ID. The Solver provides a reward amount to incentivize timely redemption.
  </Step>
  <Step title="User Finalize (addLock)">
    The user observes the Solver's lock on the destination chain and finalizes the commitment on the source chain by calling `addLock()` or `addLockSig()`, specifying a reduced timelock and confirming the Solver as the `srcReceiver`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Redemption & Completion">
    The Solver reveals the secret to claim funds on both chains, completing the swap. If the Solver fails to act reliably, the Auction Manager applies penalties (reputation loss, slashing).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Auction Manager Responsibilities

- **Solver Registration & Tracking**: Maintains a registry of active Solvers and tracks their reputation scores and performance history.
- **Quote Evaluation**: Receives swap intents and requests competitive quotes from eligible Solvers on the required chains.
- **Winner Selection**: Selects the best Solver based on price, latency, and reputation metrics.
- **Reliability Enforcement**: Monitors Solver performance (on-time locks, timely redemptions, fund releases) and applies slashing based on behavior.
- **Intent Settlement**: Confirms swap completion or failure and updates Solver reputation accordingly.

## Solver Reliability & Incentives

The Auction Manager enforces Solver reliability through:

- **Reputation Score**: Each Solver maintains a reputation score that influences future quote acceptance and auction selection.
- **Reward/Slashing Mechanism**: Solvers who fail to lock, redeem, or release user funds are penalized through slashing; other Solvers can earn rewards by completing the swap on the failed Solver's behalf.
- **Auction Selection Bias**: The Auction Manager favors Solvers with higher reputation scores and progressively reduces winning probability for unreliable Solvers.
