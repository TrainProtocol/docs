### Solver Fails to Act on the User's Commitment/Intent
In a rare scenario where the winning Solver fails to act on the User's commitment, other auction participants have a chance to lock instead of the winner. If all participants fail to act, the User only needs to wait for the timelock period (usually ~15 minutes) to receive their funds back.

    participant P1 as User

    P1->>SC: commit()

    Note over P1,SC: Timelock passes
    P1->>SC: refund()
    SC-->>P1: TokenRefunded
```
</Accordion>

### User Fails to Act on the Solver's Lock

If the User does not act on the lock created by the Solver, both parties can refund their funds after the timelock period expires.

### Solver Fails to Release the User's Funds

In scenarios where the Solver releases their funds but fails to release the User's funds, the User can capture the secret used to release the Solver's funds. The User can then use this secret to manually release their own funds on the destination chain.

### Solver Fails to Release Any Funds

If the Solver fails to release any funds, the User can wait for the timelock period to expire and then refund their funds.
