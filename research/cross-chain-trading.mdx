The TRAIN Protocol allows two parties to exchange assets across different blockchain networks using an [enhanced version of Atomic Swaps](/protocol/atomic-swaps-prehtlc) known as PreHTLCs. While this method is effective, it introduces specific operational constraints that influence the type of market the TRAIN Protocol can realistically support. This document outlines these limitations and explains the kinds of participants and markets that can emerge as a result.

### Premise 1
TRAIN Protocol operates through a sequential process:
1. Party 1 locks funds for Party 2.
2. Party 2 locks funds for Party 1.
3. Party 1 then chooses either to:
   - Release the funds and complete the trade.
   - Cancel and refund.

### Premise 2
The total allowable operation time is limited (typically 15–20 minutes) to protect both parties. Under normal conditions, a transaction can complete within 1–2 minutes if both parties act promptly.

### Premise 3
Both Party 1 and Party 2 can cancel the transaction at any time before finalization without penalty (except for paying blockchain transaction fees).

### Premise 4
Completing a trade involves transaction fees (gas fees) for both parties, incurred regardless of whether the trade is completed or canceled.

### Premise 5
Due to the time window (up to 20 minutes), market prices for assets may fluctuate:
- If the market price moves unfavorably for Party 2, they have a strong incentive to cancel the trade.
- If the market price moves favorably for Party 1, they have a strong incentive to proceed, putting Party 2 at a disadvantage.

### Premise 6
If both parties act rationally to maximize profit, no stable market equilibrium can be formed under these conditions. Rational actors will cancel trades whenever market movements make it unprofitable for them.

### Premise 7
A sustainable market can only exist if one side of the trade (Party 1) is not motivated purely by profit maximization, but rather by necessity. For example, a person needing gasoline in an emergency may be willing to pay a slightly elevated price without overanalyzing market conditions.

### Premise 8
In this market:
- Party 1 behaves as a retail, non-sophisticated participant.
- Their primary goal is to execute the trade for practical or urgent reasons rather than to optimize financial outcomes.

### Premise 9
Party 2, as a more strategic actor, must offer prices that balance two factors:
1. The price must not be so unfavorable that Party 1 refuses the trade.
2. The price must factor in potential market fluctuations over the next 20 minutes to ensure Party 2 will still want to complete the trade (thus avoiding wasted transaction fees).

## Conclusion

The TRAIN Protocol inherently creates a specialized type of cross-chain market:
- A market where Party 1 acts out of necessity rather than trading sophistication.
- A market where Party 2 strategically prices the trade, accounting for volatility and transaction costs.
- A market that cannot support active speculative traders on both sides because the structure incentivizes trade cancellations under rational profit-seeking behavior.

Thus, TRAIN enables cross-chain markets not by simulating traditional exchanges, but by creating a transaction environment that serves users prioritizing execution certainty over financial optimization.
