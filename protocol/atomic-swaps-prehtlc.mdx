Think of sending assets across different blockchains like sending a package through international mail - you want to make sure it arrives safely and that both parties keep their promises. That's where PreHTLC comes in. It's our improved version of blockchain asset exchange that makes the process simpler and safer for everyone.

### What Makes PreHTLC Special?

PreHTLC is like having a trusted shipping service that handles all the complex paperwork for you. Here's what makes it better than traditional methods:

- **You Don't Handle the Security Keys**: Just like you don't need to know how postal security works to send a package, the Solver (think of them as your shipping service) handles all the complex security keys.
- **No Extra Costs on the Destination Chain**: Imagine not needing to pay customs fees in advance - the Solver handles the delivery costs on the destination blockchain.

### Is It Safe?

Absolutely! Even though the Solver handles the security keys (like a shipping service handling your package), they can't access your assets without your permission. It's like having a package delivery system where:

1. You can always track your package
2. The courier can't access the contents
3. You get your money back if delivery fails
4. Everything is verified by the blockchain

The protocol even includes a reward system - think of it as insurance that motivates everyone to complete their part properly.

### What About Staying Connected?

While PreHTLC makes most of the process automatic, you'll still need to be online briefly to confirm the final step of the exchange. It's like signing for a package delivery - a quick action that confirms everything is in order. The good news is that all the transaction details are safely stored on the blockchain, so you won't lose track of anything even if your internet connection drops.
