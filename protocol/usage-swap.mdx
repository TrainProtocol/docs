# How to Swap Assets Between Chains

Want to move your assets from one blockchain to another? Here's how the TRAIN Protocol makes it easy and secure.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Available Routes">
    First, the system checks the [Discovery](/protocol/discovery) contract - think of it as a directory that shows you:
    - Which networks you can send assets to
    - Which Solvers (special services that help move your assets) are available
    - What routes you can use between different chains
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get the Best Price">
    Once you know where you can send your assets, the system:
    - Sends your request to the [Auction](/protocol/auction) marketplace
    - Collects offers from available Solvers
    - Finds you the best price for your transfer
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete the Secure Transfer">
    With the route and price confirmed, the system:
    - Uses [PreHTLCs](/protocol/atomic-swaps-prehtlc) (special smart contracts) to ensure your transfer is secure
    - Locks your assets safely during the transfer process
    - Only completes the swap when both sides of the transaction are guaranteed
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why Choose TRAIN for Your Swaps?

TRAIN makes moving assets between blockchains:

- **Safe**: You're always in control of your assets
- **Transparent**: You can see exactly what's happening at each step
