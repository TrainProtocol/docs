- **Homogeneous Security**: The protocol establishes consistent cryptographic security for all permissionless participants. Security attributes remain unchanged when adding new networks or Solvers.

- **Battle-Tested**: The core technology of Atomic Swaps (HTLC) has been successfully used in production for the Lightning Network.

- **No Pools**: No single contract holds large amounts of funds. This design choice significantly reduces the risk of being targeted by attackers.

- **Immutability**: The contracts are immutable. This eliminates the risks associated with upgrades.

- **Simplicity**: PreHTLC contracts are straightforward locking mechanisms. Each contract typically consists of about [200 lines of code](https://github.com/TrainProtocol/contracts/blob/main/chains/evm/solidity/contracts/Train.sol) in any smart contract language.
