- **Homogeneous Security**: The protocol establishes consistent cryptographic security for all permissionless participants. Security attributes remain unchanged when adding new networks or Solvers.
- **Battle Tested**: The core technology of Atomic Swaps (HTLC) is successfully used in production for the Lightning Network.
- **No Pools**: No single contract holds large amounts of funds, reducing the risk of being targeted by attackers.
- **Immutability**: The contracts are immutable, eliminating the risks associated with upgrades.
- **Simplicity**: PreHTLC contracts are straightforward locking mechanisms, typically consisting of about [200 lines of code](https://github.com/TrainProtocol/contracts/blob/main/chains/evm/solidity/contracts/Train.sol) in any smart contract language.
