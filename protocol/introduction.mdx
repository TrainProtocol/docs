# What is TRAIN?

TRAIN is a simple but powerful way to move your crypto assets between different blockchain networks. Think of it as a secure bridge that lets you transfer assets from one blockchain to another without having to trust any middlemen.

## Key Benefits

- **Secure & Trustless**: No middlemen or gatekeepers - your assets are protected by strong cryptography
- **Direct Transfers**: Assets move directly between you and another party (called a solver)
- **Browser-Based Security**: Security checks happen right in your browser
- **Open Network**: Anyone can add new networks or become a solver

## How Does It Work?

TRAIN uses a special type of transfer called "Atomic Swaps" that ensures either both parties get their assets, or nobody does - making it impossible to lose funds during a transfer. Here's a simple breakdown:

1. You (the user) say what you want to transfer and where
2. A solver (someone who can help with the transfer) makes you an offer 
3. If you accept, the transfer happens automatically and securely

<Note>
Unlike traditional bridges, TRAIN doesn't hold your funds in a central place. Transfers happen directly between parties using secure cryptographic protocols.
