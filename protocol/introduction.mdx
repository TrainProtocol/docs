The **TRAIN** Protocol (**TR**ustless **A**tomic **IN**tents) is a peer-to-peer system for bridging and swapping crypto assets between blockchain networks. The protocol is implemented as a set of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts deployed to all [supported networks](/protocol/contracts).

- TRAIN is built on top of an [improved version of Atomic Swaps](/protocol/atomic-swaps-prehtlc). This allows two parties—the **User** and the **Solver**—to exchange assets trust-minimizedly across different chains. Users send their **Intents** to Solvers, who fulfill these Intents using Atomic Swaps.
- There are **no third parties or gatekeepers**. The security of the exchange is fully ensured by:
  - The cryptographic protocol (Atomic Swaps)
  - Local verification through a [Light Client](/protocol/dApp) running in the User's browser
- An on-chain [Discovery Registry](/protocol/discovery) where new Solvers and Networks can [permissionlessly](/protocol/usage-add-new-network) register.
