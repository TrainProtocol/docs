The **TRAIN** [**TR**ustless **A**tomic **IN**tents] protocol is a peer-to-peer system for bridging/swapping crypto assets from one blockchain network to another. The protocol is implemented as a set of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts, deployed to all [supported networks](/protocol/contracts).

- TRAIN is built on top of an [improved version of Atomic Swaps](/protocol/atomic-swaps-preHTLC), which allows two parties to exchange assets trustlessly across different chains. Specifically, the two parties are the **User** and the **Solver**. Users send their **Intents** to Solvers, who fulfill them using Atomic Swaps.
- There are **no third parties or gatekeepers**. The security of the exchange is fully ensured by the cryptographic protocol and [Light Client](/protocol/dApp) running on the user's browser.
- On-chain [Discovery](/protocol/discovery) registry, where new Solvers and networks can [permissionlessly](/protocol/usage-add-new-network) register.
