The **TRAIN** (**TR**ustless **A**tomic **IN**tents) Protocol is a peer-to-peer system for bridging and swapping crypto assets between blockchain networks. The protocol is implemented as a set of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts deployed to all [supported networks](/protocol/contracts).

Key Features:
- Built on top of an [improved version of Atomic Swaps](/protocol/atomic-swaps-prehtlc) that enables trustless asset exchange between parties across different chains. The two participating parties are the **User** and the **Solver**. Users send their **Intents** to Solvers, who fulfill them using Atomic Swaps.
- Operates without third parties or gatekeepers. The security of each exchange is fully ensured by the cryptographic protocol and [Light Client](/protocol/dApp) running in the user's browser.
- Features an on-chain [Discovery](/protocol/discovery) Registry where new Solvers and networks can [permissionlessly](/protocol/usage-add-new-network) register.
