### Overview

The [TRAIN Bridge dApp](https://app.train.tech) serves as the central interface for seamless cross-chain transactions. It integrates with the Discovery mechanism to fetch available Solvers and participates in the Solver Auction process to determine optimal routes for bridging.

The dApp has **three** main responsibilities:

1. Connecting to the [Discovery Registry](/protocol/discovery) to fetch available Solvers and Networks
2. Connecting to the [Auction](/protocol/auction) to transmit the User's intent and get quotes from Solvers
3. Executing an [Atomic Swap](/protocol/atomic-swaps-prehtlc) flow

### Observing the Destination Network

The dApp must observe the destination lock created by the Solver and provide the `hashlock` to the User to complete the Atomic Swap process. The dApp can observe this transaction through the following methods, listed in order of priority:

1. Bootstrap a Light Client (e.g., [Helios](https://github.com/a16z/helios)) for the destination chain and read the lock state from it
2. If no Light Client is available, read and verify the lock state from multiple RPC providers
