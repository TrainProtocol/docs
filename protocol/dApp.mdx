### Overview

The [TRAIN Bridge dApp](https://app.train.tech) serves as the central interface for seamless cross-chain transactions. It submits user intents to the centralized [Auction Manager](/protocol/auction), receives the winning Solver quote, and orchestrates the [Atomic Swap](/protocol/atomic-swaps-prehtlc) flow.

The dApp has **three** main responsibilities:

1. Accept user swap intent and submit it to the [Auction Manager](/protocol/auction)
2. Display the winning Solver quote and allow the user to commit funds (specifying the winning Solver)
3. Execute the [Atomic Swap](/protocol/atomic-swaps-prehtlc) flow (observe destination lock, provide hashlock to user)

### Observing the Destination Network

The dApp must observe the destination lock created by the Solver and provide the `hashlock` to the User to complete the Atomic Swap process. The dApp can observe this transaction through the following methods, listed in order of priority:

1. Bootstrap a Light Client (e.g., [Helios](https://github.com/a16z/helios)) for the destination chain and read the lock state from it
2. If no Light Client is available, read and verify the lock state from multiple RPC providers
