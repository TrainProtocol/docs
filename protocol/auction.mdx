The auction system in TRAIN uses a centralized Auction Manager: registered Solvers compete to quote on user swap intents, the manager selects the best quote, and the user commits funds naming the winning Solver. The centralized manager can then enforce reliability (for example by slashing or temporarily restricting misbehaving solvers).

In short:

- Solvers register and advertise availability.
- The Auction Manager requests quotes, selects the best offer, and returns the winner to the dApp/user.
- The user commits funds and specifies the winning Solver in the commit transaction.
- The chosen Solver fulfills the destination-side lock and completes the swap; failures trigger enforcement actions by the manager.
