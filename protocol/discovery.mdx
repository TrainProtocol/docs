The TRAIN protocol maintains an on-chain Discovery Registry for protocol metadata, ensuring users, auctions, and integrators can discover Solvers efficiently. Through this registry, Solvers register both their addresses and the routes they support.

### Registration Security

The Discovery Registry is permissionless, allowing any entity to register as a Solver. This open nature necessitates flood protection to prevent malicious actors from:
- Registering numerous non-functional ("empty") Solvers
- Potentially executing DDoS attacks on the protocol

### Protection Mechanism

While staking might seem like a viable solution for security, it presents limitations. Staking only works effectively if the network where the Discovery Registry is deployed can determine a Solver's dishonesty. However, autonomous verification of Solver behavior across chains is not possible, as the registry chain cannot access information about Solver behavior in other networks.

### Token Burning Solution

To address these security challenges, the Discovery Registry implements a token burning mechanism:
- Active and registering Solvers must lock a specified amount of tokens
- These locked tokens are systematically burned (daily/monthly) as a protocol fee
- The burning serves as an ongoing cost for operating as a Solver

This approach ensures that maintaining malicious Solver registrations becomes economically unfeasible while providing a sustainable model for legitimate Solver operations.
