## What is Discovery?

TRAIN uses a smart contract called the Discovery Registry to help users find available bridge services. Think of it like a public directory that lists all the trusted parties (called Solvers) who can help transfer your assets between different blockchains.

### How Discovery Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Finding Available Services">
    When you want to bridge assets between networks, the Discovery Registry shows you which Solvers can help with your specific transfer.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Quality Control">
    To make sure only legitimate Solvers are listed, the Discovery system requires them to lock up some TRAIN tokens to provide their services.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Ongoing Fee">
    Solvers pay a small fee (in tokens) for staying active in the registry. This fee is automatically deducted daily/monthly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Why This Matters

<Card title="Security & Trust" icon="shield-check">
  The Discovery system helps protect users by making sure Solvers have something at stake - their locked tokens - which encourages them to provide reliable service.

<Note>
  While anyone can register as a Solver (making it permissionless), the token requirement helps prevent spam and ensures only serious providers join the network.
</Note>

### Simple Example

Think of it like a ride-sharing app's driver registration:
- Drivers (Solvers) must register and put down a deposit
- They pay regular fees to stay active on the platform
- Users can easily find available drivers for their route
- Bad actors are discouraged by the financial requirements
