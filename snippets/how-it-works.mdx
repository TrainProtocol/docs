The TRAIN Bridge deployment system follows a series of automated steps to establish a secure, trustless bridge between networks. Built on the [TRAIN Protocol](protocol/introduction), the bridge utilizes advanced Atomic Swaps technology for seamless and secure cross-chain transactions. Learn more about the protocol's capabilities and features.

### Deployment Steps

The system automatically:

- Validates network parameters (e.g., Chain IDs, RPCs)
- Bootstraps the Solver with initial liquidity from the Canonical Bridge
- Deploys [TRAIN Contracts](https://github.com/trainprotocol/contracts) on your network
- Configures routes for all existing networks and supported assets
- Adds your network to the [TRAIN App](https://app.train.tech)
