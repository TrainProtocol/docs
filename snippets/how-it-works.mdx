The TRAIN bridge deployment system makes it easy to connect different blockchain networks securely. Built on the [TRAIN Protocol](protocol/introduction), it uses a technology called Atomic Swaps to ensure your transactions are safe and reliable when moving assets between networks.

### What Happens During Deployment?

We've broken down the process into simple, automated steps that happen behind the scenes:

1. **Security Check** 
   - We verify all your network's important details (like chain IDs and connection points)
   - This ensures everything is set up correctly and securely

2. **Getting Started** 
   - We set up initial funds using your network's main bridge
   - This provides the liquidity needed for transactions to work smoothly

3. **Setting Up the Bridge** 
   - We install [TRAIN Contracts](https://github.com/trainprotocol/contracts) on your network
   - These smart contracts handle all the secure trading mechanics

4. **Making Connections** 
   - We create paths to all existing networks
   - This allows assets to move between your network and others

5. **Going Live** 
   - Your network gets added to the [TRAIN App](https://app.train.tech)
   - Users can immediately start using the bridge to transfer assets
